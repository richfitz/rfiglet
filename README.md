rfiglet is a pure-R implementation of [FIGlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIGlet) (Frank, Ian and Glenn's letters) a classic system for creating text banners in many fonts.


```
#> Error in loadNamespace(name): there is no package called 'rfiglet'
```

There are many FIGlet compatible fonts; to keep things small, this package only includes the base set included by FIGlet


```
#> Error in loadNamespace(name): there is no package called 'rfiglet'
```

However, several hundred extra fonts can be installed using

```r
rfiglet::figlet_download_fonts()
```


```
#> Error in loadNamespace(name): there is no package called 'rfiglet'
```

```r
remotes::install_github("richfitz/rfiglet", upgrade = FALSE)
```
